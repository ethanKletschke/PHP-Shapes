## What is This Project?

This is a shapes class library built solely with PHP. Pretty self-explanatory.

This project is mainly a skills reference for my portfolio, so it's definitely not built
for use in production (I mean, why would you use these basic shapes in a production
environment anyways?). 

There's tons of documentation (and "normal") comments which explain the code pretty well, 
so it'd be redundant to talk about the code and classes here. :)

## Inspiration

This project was (surprisingly) inspired by 
[a _**TypeScript**_ example on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_classes.php#:~:text=the%20implements%20keyword.-,Example,-interface%20Shape%20%7B),
which is a site I used to self-teach a lot of my
programming skills.

## Most Recent Change (v0.4.1)

- Fixed unit testing to properly run with GitHub workflow.
